# Product Context: HPE_volleyball

## Why This Project Exists

The HPE_volleyball project was created to address a significant challenge in volleyball coaching: the time-intensive process of analyzing training sessions. Elite beach volleyball coaches spend hours reviewing video footage to assess player performance, technique, and tactical decisions. This manual analysis is:

1. **Time-consuming**: Coaches may spend 2-3 hours analyzing a 1-hour training session
2. **Subjective**: Manual analysis can vary based on the coach's focus and perception
3. **Limited in scope**: Coaches may miss subtle patterns or movements due to cognitive limitations
4. **Delayed feedback**: Analysis time delays the delivery of insights to players

By automating the detection, tracking, and pose estimation of players, this project aims to dramatically reduce the time coaches spend on video analysis while potentially increasing the depth and objectivity of the insights gained.

## Problems It Solves

### For Coaches

1. **Time Efficiency**: Reduces hours of manual video analysis to minutes of automated processing
2. **Objective Measurement**: Provides consistent, quantitative data on player movements and actions
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Captures all player movements throughout the session, not just highlights
4. **Focus on Coaching**: Allows coaches to spend more time on strategy and player development rather than video analysis

### For Players

1. **Faster Feedback**: Receive analysis and insights sooner after training sessions
2. **Detailed Movement Analysis**: Get precise feedback on body mechanics and technique
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor improvements in movement patterns and actions over time

### For Sports Science

1. **Data Collection**: Generates structured datasets for research on volleyball biomechanics
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Enables identification of movement patterns correlated with performance
3. **Injury Prevention**: Potential to identify movement patterns that may lead to injuries

## How It Should Work

From the user's perspective (primarily coaches), the system should:

1. **Fully Automated Processing**: Automatically detect and process new training videos as they appear in storage
2. **Background Operation**: Run analysis in the background without requiring manual intervention
3. **Accept Standard Video Input**: Work with typical training session recordings (1920x1080, 50fps)
4. **Provide Visual Verification**: Generate output video with overlaid tracking and pose data
5. **Export Structured Data**: Save detection, tracking, and pose data in a format suitable for further analysis
6. **Eventually Identify Actions**: Automatically recognize and tag volleyball-specific actions (spikes, serves, etc.)

The ultimate workflow will be:
1. Training session is automatically recorded (already implemented)
2. Video is automatically saved to designated storage
3. System detects new video and automatically processes it
4. System outputs annotated video and structured data
5. Coach reviews results and derives insights

Currently, the project is working with manually saved videos in the `/data/` directory, but the end goal is full automation of the pipeline.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Automation**: Minimal to no manual intervention required in the video analysis process
2. **Speed**: Process videos faster than real-time to enable quick analysis
3. **Accuracy**: Reliable player tracking and pose estimation to ensure trustworthy results
4. **Flexibility**: Work with various camera setups and training scenarios
5. **Interpretability**: Present results in a way that's meaningful to volleyball coaches

## Success Metrics

The project will be considered successful if it:

1. **Reduces Analysis Time**: Cuts video analysis time by at least 50%
2. **Maintains Accuracy**: Achieves >90% accuracy in player tracking and pose estimation
3. **Enables New Insights**: Helps coaches identify patterns or issues not previously noticed
4. **Achieves Adoption**: Is regularly used by the target coaching staff
5. **Improves Training**: Ultimately contributes to improved player performance
6. **Operates Autonomously**: Successfully runs the entire pipeline automatically when new videos are detected
