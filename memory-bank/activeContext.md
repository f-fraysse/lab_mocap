# Active Context: Lab MoCap

## Current Work Focus

The Lab MoCap project has successfully transitioned from the volleyball HPE project to a biomechanics laboratory setup. The current focus is on **specialized biomechanical analysis applications** with real-time RTSP stream processing and integrated human pose estimation.

### Primary Achievements

1. **Successfully created and tested `lab_mocap_stream.py`** - Base RTSP streaming with HPE pipeline
2. **Developed `lab_mocap_2Dsquat.py`** - Specialized 2D squat analysis application with:
   - Real-time knee flexion angle calculation and display
   - Automatic squat repetition counting based on hip-knee position analysis
   - Enhanced visual feedback with large status indicators
   - Custom left leg visualization (hip-knee-ankle only)
   - 3-frame squat validation system for accuracy

### Current Performance Metrics

Based on initial testing with live RTSP streams:

| Component       | Avg Time (ms) | Performance Notes                           |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Total**       | **38.0**      | **~26 FPS** - Excellent real-time performance |
| Capture         | 12.4          | Includes RTSP stream latency                |
| Detection       | 21.8          | Primary processing component                |
| Tracking        | 0.1           | Very efficient (ByteTrack)                 |
| Pose Estimation | 1.9           | Highly optimized with batch processing     |
| Display/Logging | 1.2           | Minimal overhead                           |

### Camera Configuration System

Implemented clean configuration system:
```python
CAMERA_MODE = "single"  # Options: "single", "all"
SELECTED_CAMERA = 1     # Which camera (1-4) for single mode
```

**Single Mode**: Processes one selected camera stream
**All Mode**: Processes all 4 cameras, automatically stitches into 2x2 grid (1920x1080 total)

### RTSP Integration Details

- **Camera URLs**: 4 laboratory cameras with RTSP streams
- **Stream Handling**: Robust error handling for connection issues
- **Frame Stitching**: Automatic 2x2 grid layout for multi-camera mode
- **Resource Management**: Proper camera initialization and cleanup

## Recent Changes

2. **Developed `lab_mocap_2Dsquat.py`**: Specialized squat analysis application with dual functionality
3. **Preserved All Optimizations**: Maintained batch processing and performance optimizations from volleyball project
4. **Implemented Biomechanical Analysis**: Real-time knee angle calculation and squat repetition counting
5. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: Large status indicators and custom skeleton visualization
6. **Added Custom Drawing System**: `draw_skeleton_custom()` function for selective keypoint display
7. **Successful Testing**: Confirmed real-time performance with specialized analysis features

## Squat Analysis Features (`lab_mocap_2Dsquat.py`)

### Dual Analysis System
- **Knee Flexion Angle**: Real-time calculation using hip-knee-ankle keypoints
  - Formula: `180Â° - arccos(dot_product)` where 0Â° = straight leg
  - Yellow text display near knee with black background
  - Only calculated when all three keypoints have confidence > 0.5

- **Squat Repetition Counter**: Automatic counting based on biomechanical criteria
  - Uses hip-knee vertical position comparison
  - 3-frame consecutive validation prevents false positives
  - Large green "SQUAT" indicator (270x100 pixels) when validated
  - Enhanced rep counter with 50% larger text

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Custom Skeleton Drawing**: `draw_skeleton_custom()` function with selective rendering
- **State Machine Logic**: STANDING â†’ SQUAT_VALIDATED â†’ REP_COMPLETED â†’ STANDING
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing keypoints and calculation errors
- **Performance**: Maintains ~26 FPS with additional analysis overhead
- **Configuration**: Uses camera 4 in single mode for focused analysis
