# Project Progress: Lab MoCap

## What Works

### âœ… Real-time RTSP Processing Pipeline

1. **RTSP Stream Capture**
   - Successfully connects to and processes 4 laboratory RTSP camera streams
   - Handles individual camera failures gracefully
   - Efficient frame capture with error recovery (~12.4ms average including latency)

2. **Camera Configuration System**
   - Clean configuration-driven camera management
   - Single camera mode: Process one selected camera (1-4)
   - Multi-camera mode: Process all 4 cameras with automatic 2x2 stitching
   - Dynamic resource allocation based on selected mode

3. **Human Detection**
   - RTMDet model successfully detects humans in laboratory environment
   - Medium-sized model (RTMDet-m) provides good accuracy for biomechanics applications
   - **Current performance: ~21.8ms per frame** (optimized preprocessing)

4. **Subject Tracking**
   - ByteTrack algorithm successfully maintains subject IDs
   - Handles occlusions and multiple subjects effectively
   - Very efficient performance (~0.1ms per frame)
   - Consistent ID assignment throughout sessions

5. **Pose Estimation**
   - RTMPose model successfully estimates human poses in real-time
   - Medium-sized model (RTMPose-m) provides accurate keypoint detection
   - **Current performance: ~1.9ms per frame** (batch processing optimization)
   - Suitable for biomechanical analysis applications

6. **Real-time Display and Monitoring**
   - Live video display with pose overlays and bounding boxes
   - Real-time performance metrics displayed on stream
   - Comprehensive timing information for all pipeline components

### âœ… Specialized Biomechanical Analysis Applications

7. **2D Squat Analysis System (`lab_mocap_2Dsquat.py`)**
   - **Knee Flexion Angle Calculation**: Real-time computation using hip-knee-ankle keypoints
     - Custom formula: `180Â° - arccos(dot_product)` where 0Â° = straight leg
     - Yellow text display with black background for visibility
     - Only calculated when all three keypoints have confidence > 0.5
   
   - **Automatic Squat Repetition Counting**: Biomechanically-based rep detection
     - Uses hip-knee vertical position comparison for squat validation
     - 3-frame consecutive validation system prevents false positives
     - State machine: STANDING â†’ SQUAT_VALIDATED â†’ REP_COMPLETED â†’ STANDING
     - Large green "SQUAT" indicator (270x100 pixels) during validated squats
     - Enhanced rep counter with 50% larger text display

8. **Custom Skeleton Visualization System**
   - **`draw_skeleton_custom()` Function**: Selective keypoint and connection rendering
     - Configurable keypoint selection (supports left leg only visualization)
     - Customizable colors, line thickness, and keypoint sizes
     - Efficient rendering with enhanced visibility options
   - **Left Leg Focus**: Hip-knee-ankle visualization for squat analysis
     - Larger keypoints (radius=5) and thicker lines (width=3) for better visibility
     - Green color scheme for left leg components

### âœ… Performance Optimization
