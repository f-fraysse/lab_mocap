# Project Progress: HPE_volleyball

## What Works

### âœ… Core Pipeline

1. **Video Input**
   - Successfully reads video files using OpenCV
   - Handles standard 1920x1080, 50fps volleyball training videos
   - Frame extraction is efficient (~5-6ms per frame)

2. **Player Detection**
   - RTMDet model successfully detects players in frames
   - Medium-sized model (RTMDet-m) provides good accuracy
   - Detection works reliably even with partial occlusions
   - **Current performance: ~19ms per frame** (Post-normalization optimization). Detection runs every frame.

3. **Player Tracking**
   - ByteTrack algorithm successfully maintains player IDs
   - Handles occlusions and crossing paths effectively
   - Very efficient performance (~1ms per frame)
   - Consistent ID assignment throughout video sequences

4. **Pose Estimation**
   - RTMPose model successfully estimates player poses
   - Medium-sized model (RTMPose-m) provides good accuracy
   - Correctly identifies keypoints for volleyball-specific poses
   - **Current performance: ~11ms per frame** (Post-batching optimization)

5. **Output Generation**
   - Visual output with overlaid bounding boxes, IDs, and pose skeletons
   - HDF5 data storage with structured organization
   - Track presence indexing for efficient data retrieval
