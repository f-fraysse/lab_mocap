3. **Human Detection**
   - RTMDet model successfully detects humans in laboratory environment
   - Medium-sized model (RTMDet-m) provides good accuracy for biomechanics applications
   - **Current performance: ~21.8ms per frame** (optimized preprocessing)

4. **Subject Tracking**
   - ByteTrack algorithm successfully maintains subject IDs
   - Handles occlusions and multiple subjects effectively
   - Very efficient performance (~0.1ms per frame)
   - Consistent ID assignment throughout sessions

     - Time history graph in bottom right corner (last 5 seconds)
     - White background, black axes, thick blue plot line
     - Y-axis: -5Â° to 180Â° with gridlines at 0Â°, 45Â°, 90Â°, 135Â°, 180Â°
     - Current angle value displayed in top right (yellow text, black background)
     - Only calculated when all three keypoints have confidence > 0.5
     - Uses `collections.deque` with 1000-entry capacity for rolling window
   
   - **Automatic Squat Repetition Counting**: Biomechanically-based rep detection
     - Uses hip-knee vertical position comparison for squat validation
     - 3-frame consecutive validation system prevents false positives

     - Customizable colors, line thickness, and keypoint sizes
     - Efficient rendering with enhanced visibility options
   - **Left Leg Focus**: Hip-knee-ankle visualization for squat analysis
     - Larger keypoints (radius=5) and thicker lines (width=3) for better visibility
     - Green color scheme for left leg components
